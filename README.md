# Active Time Battle System
Active Time Battle is a type of turn-based combat system in which each character has its own time bar to attack at its own pace. There is no pause for your action, as in the classic turn-based system.

# Introduction
The system was created while participating in a game jam. The team and I were creating a classic 2D RPG with turn-based combat. The game was created using Unreal Engine 5 and C++. My task was to create the combat system and implement the designers' ideas, as well as integrate the system with the game's UI. The system consists of 6 types of activities: attack, defense, crystal skills, weapon skills, items, escape. Each of them uses actions which are templates for skills which can be easily created in 9 different prepared types. The video below demonstrates a sample gameplay showing most of the elements of the system.

# Playable demo
Together with the team, we have created a playable demo where you can test the system in action. The demo can be downloaded on the itchi.io platform:
